[h1]Short Description:[/h1]

- This is a fork of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2387799348]Ethics and Civics Alternative - Redux by LordofLA[/url], which is a fork of the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1790861374]Ethics and Civics Alternative mod by Petruxa[/url]. Credit to both of them for the vast majority of the base code.

- In addition, I've merged 2 other mods into this one. My other mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2158334880]More Authorities[/url], and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2462721212]Relytor's Empire Governance - Redux by LordofLA[/url], which is a fork of the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1790861374]Relytor's Empire Governance mod by relytor[/url].

[h1]New Authorities:[/h1]

[b]Democratic Autocracy:[/b]

- This system of government democratically elects a dictator for life. When your ruler  dies, a new one will be elected the same as in democracies, with faction support mattering and whatnot.

----

[b]Term Limited:[/b]

- This government form elects a ruler for a single 15-year term. After their term, leaders will go back to whatever job they had before (scientist, official, commander). However, their portrait may be changed. This is still an issue in 3.6, and may yet be resolved in the future.

----

[b]Private Corporate:[/b]

- This government is a megacorp that has a monarchy. It's a megacorp, but with Rulers for life and Heirs, just like Imperial authority.
